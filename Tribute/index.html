      <p style="color: white;">Mahendra Singh Dhoni was born on July 7, 1981 at Ranchi, Jharkhand located in the east
        corner of India. He studied at DAV
        Jawahar Vidya Mandir where he was keenly interested in football and badminton. He was the goalkeeper of his
        football team and was able to play for the
        district and state level. But on the insistence of his football coach, he tried out to play cricket. He was able
        to perform wicket keeping especially
        well which allowed him entry into a local cricket club called the Commando cricket club where he played from
        1995-1998. In the 1997/98 season,
        his superb performances in the Vinoo Mankad Under-16 Championship attracted the selector’s eye. An attacking
        right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest finishers in
        limited-overs cricket. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut in December 2004 against Bangladesh, and
        played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka. Dhoni holds numerous captaincy records such as most wins
        by an Indian captain in Tests and ODIs, and most back-to-back wins by an Indian captain in ODIs.
